# Writing Questbook Games

Questbooks are games written entirely in YAML.

Here's how the format works.

## Story

It starts with a story:

```
story:
  title: "A story has a title"
  chapters:
    - a_story_also_has_chapters
    - this_is_a_list_of_the_chapter_id
    - this_stores_the_order_of_the_chapters
```

A story has a title and chapters.  Chapter have an order, players are always in the latest chapter they can access.

Stories can also have decisions, these decisions are actions that can be made in any scene or chapter, but we'll get to decisions later.
